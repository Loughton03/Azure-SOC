# Building a SOC + Honeynet in Azure (Live Traffic)

## Introduction

In this project, a mini honeynet was developed within Microsoft Azure, incorporating various log sources into a Log Analytics workspace and utilizing Microsoft Sentinel to construct attack maps, trigger alerts, and generate incidents. The objective was to measure security metrics in an insecure environment for 24 hours, implement security controls to strengthen the environment, and then measure metrics for another 24 hours to compare the results. 

The metrics we will show are:

- SecurityEvent (Windows Event Logs)
- Syslog (Linux Event Logs)
- SecurityAlert (Log Analytics Alerts Triggered)
- SecurityIncident (Incidents created by Sentinel)
- AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL (Malicious Flows allowed into our honeynet)

## Architecture After Hardening / Security Controls

The architecture of the mini honeynet in Azure consists of:

- Virtual Network (VNet)
- Network Security Group (NSG)
- Virtual Machines (2 windows, 1 linux)
- Log Analytics Workspace
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Storage Account
- Microsoft Sentinel

In the initial insecure environment, all resources were deployed with public endpoints visible to the Internet, and Network Security Groups and built-in firewalls were open. 

However, in the secured environment, Network Security Groups were strengthened by blocking ALL traffic except for the admin workstation. All other resources were safeguarded with built-in firewalls and a Private Endpoint.

## Metrics Before Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our insecure environment for 24 hours:
Start Time 2023-03-15 17:04:29
Stop Time 2023-03-16 17:04:29

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 19470
| Syslog                   | 3028
| SecurityAlert            | 10
| SecurityIncident         | 348
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 843

## Attack Maps Before Hardening / Security Controls

```All map queries actually returned no results due to no instances of malicious activity for the 24 hour period after hardening.```

## Metrics After Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our environment for another 24 hours, but after we have applied security controls:
Start Time 2023-03-18 15:37
Stop Time	2023-03-19 15:37

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 8778
| Syslog                   | 25
| SecurityAlert            | 0
| SecurityIncident         | 0
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 0

## Conclusion

After implementing security controls, the project results indicated a significant reduction in security events and incidents. 

It is worth noting that the number of security events and alerts may have been more significant if regular users heavily used the resources during the 24 hours following the implementation of security controls
